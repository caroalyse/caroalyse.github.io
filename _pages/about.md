I am a Ph.D. student at Indiana University, where I am also an Associate Instructor of Spanish. I major in Hispanic Linguistics and minor in Computational Linguistics. My main research interests include Phonetics and Phonology, Pragmatics, and Sociolinguistics. More recently, my research has focused on Laboratory Phonology, specially on perception studies.
