Dear S-280 students:

As you know, due to the global situation we are facing these days, Indiana University has decided to shift face-to-face classes to an online environment for the rest of the Spring 2020 semester. Regarding our course, more specific information will be provided through Canvas Announcements, so please keep an eye out for that. This website contains the content we were using in class before Spring Break, plus a full schedule for each of our regular class meetings for the upcoming weeks.  In this specific section you will find the material you must follow indicated for each day, as well as the assigned tasks.

If you have any question, please do not hesitate to contact me via email or Canvas.


Santi.
